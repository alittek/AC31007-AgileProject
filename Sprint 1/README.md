### Summary of Conversation/woke done:
Since it was a first day of our sprint, our scrum meeting took longer and we worked on a sprint planning. During the session we reviewed the priority sorting activity that we carried out on yesterday (on Sunday), made some changes to it and then created a sprint backlog - first we added the most important user stories, split the user stories into smaller tasks and assigned roles to every task.
We also agreed on the software that we will be using.
