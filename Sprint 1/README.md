Raised question - codding style. Solution - usage of ctrl+alt+L.
Alina presented a summary of the changes made to the product backlog (could be seen on GitHub). Team updated the sprint backlog and finalised Day 1.
Rokas' demo on Angular and Spring framework yesterday was very beneficial to everyone. All team members successfully managed to set up the environment and started working on their tasks afterwards. 
No one faced any other major issues regarding the development. Plan for today - keep working on the same tasks.
