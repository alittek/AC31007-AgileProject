### Summary of Conversation:
Since it was a first day of Sprint 2 we did not have a standard stand up. Instead, at the beginning of a meeting we spent some time looking at the sprint retrospective notes (filled in by all team members after the sprint review on Friday) to reflect on our performance in Sprint 1. We created actionable items that will be accomplished in Sprint 2. After that we held our Sprint planning - we agreed on the selected user stories, split them into detailed tasks and assigned ourselves. Plan for today is to start developing the questionnaire.
