# Software Code

All software code should be put in this folder along with either:
- The binaries to run your completed application (if desktop based)
- A link to your application running on a server (if web based)

## To Run:
1. Run backend

2. Run frontend

3. Go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console/

   log in with JDBC URL: as 'jdbc:h2:~/data/agile' and password as 'password'
   
4. Add a user to users table

   (select privilege ID: 3 - lab manager, 2 - researcher, 1 - co researcher)
   
5. Go to http://localhost:4200/

We used Intellij for running the programs.
